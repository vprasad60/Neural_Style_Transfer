# Neural_Style_Transfer
This repository presents an implementation of the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm developed by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and and Matthias Bethge and described in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf). Effectively, the algorithm will recreate the content of one image in the style of another. This implementation served as the final project for course in Deep Learning.

## Code Overview and Demonstration
### Designating Images
To run this code, add a content image to the Content_Images folder and a style image to the Style_Images folder. As an example, we will use 'mount_rushmore' as our content image and 'starry_night' as our style image. 

### Running the Code

```python
# Establish variables
iters = 25
alpha = 10
beta = 1e4
img_size = 512
model = model_selection()
content_img = 'neckarfront'
style_img = 'haystacks'
input_img = 'content'
content_layers = ['21']
style_layers = ['0','5','10','19','28']
style_weights = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
```

After running the algorithm you will see a progress bar as the iterations are completed.
