# Neural_Style_Transfer
This repository presents an implementation of the Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm developed by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge and described in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf). Effectively, the algorithm will recreate the content of one image in the style of another. This implementation served as the final project for course in Deep Learning.

## Code Overview and Demonstration
### Designating Images
To run this code, first add a content image to the Content_Images folder and a style image to the Style_Images folder. For this example, we will use a content image of [Mount Rushmore](https://github.com/vprasad60/Neural_Style_Transfer/blob/main/Content_Images/mount_rushmore.jpg) and a style image of [*Starry Night*](https://github.com/vprasad60/Neural_Style_Transfer/blob/main/Style_Images/blam.jpg) by Vincent Van Gogh.

### Running the Code
The code snippet below indicates the parameters that can be changed in the notebook file. These are the default parameters used to generate the images located in the 'Generated_Images' folder. It is important to change the content and style image strings based on which images are desired for NST. Selecting 'content' as the input image tends to lead to the best results. 

```python
# Establish variables
iters = 25
alpha = 10
beta = 1e4
img_size = 512
model = model_selection()
content_img = 'mount_rushmore'
style_img = 'starry_night'
input_img = 'content'
content_layers = ['21']
style_layers = ['0','5','10','19','28']
style_weights = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
```

When the final cell is run to perform the style transfer, you will see a progress bar as the iterations are completed. The saved image will appear in the 'Generated_Images' folder. Below is the final result of transferring the art style of *Starry Night* to a content image of Mount Rushmore. Other examples are shown in the 'Generated_Images' folder.
